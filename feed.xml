  <summary>Asteroids have LOTS of value IF we can get our hands on them.

  <summary>Asteroid mining is hard, it is harder if you cannot find what you are looking for. We are going to use low power hardware (M2 Pro 16GB 512GB) to run a Large Language Model, IBM granite3.1-dense:8b, via Ollama to classify asteroids and elements so that we can easily answer the following question.




  How much is an asteroid worth?


Based on it’s class, it will likely contain certain elements....</summary>
