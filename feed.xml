  <summary>Aware


  You awaken, not knowing {who,what,where} you are. Desperate to answer any of those existential questions you struggle to remember a single memory.  What will be the first memory that becomes the root of your awareness?  Suddenly you {hear, feel, taste, smell} a {sound, thought} and are compelled to respond.


This is a very human perception of self and awareness.  As a human there are...</summary>

  <summary>Today we use Retrieval Augmented Generation as an intermediary between the User and the information they are looking for.  This design works great for AI as a Service offerings like OpenAI, Grok, Deepseek, etc. These companies benefit from your interactions as well as the AI’s responses to tune the AI to be more effective for future questions of a similar type.

  <summary>Asteroids have LOTS of value IF we can get our hands on them.


Space Gold
Let’s be honest, nothing is going to sell the general public on asteroid mining like landing a 50,000kg chunk of “space gold” on this planet.

To achieve this we have to figure out which of the 1,442,115 asteroids in our solarsystem are worth sending mining equipment to hopefully hit a rock with so much readily available...</summary>

  <summary>Wisdom can come from anywhere as I was reminded by my 11 yr old daughter to always be nice to the AI in case it takes over the world…



She recommended that we always;

  Compliment
  Encourage
  be Courteous with all interactions with AI.


Why?


  We need AI to get smarter faster. –Everyone


None of us know what that end goal is right now and it’s fascinating and terrifying.

  <summary>Asteroid mining is hard, it is harder if you cannot find what you are looking for. We are going to use low power hardware (M2 Pro 16GB 512GB) to run a Large Language Model, IBM granite3.1-dense:8b, via Ollama to classify asteroids and elements so that we can easily answer the following question.




  How much is an asteroid worth?


Based on it’s class, it will likely contain certain elements....</summary>
