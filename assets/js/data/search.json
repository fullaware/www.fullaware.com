    "content": "Today we use Retrieval Augmented Generation as an intermediary between the User and the information they are looking for.  This design works great for AI as a Service offerings like OpenAI, Grok, Deepseek, etc. These companies benefit from your interactions as well as the AI‚Äôs responses to tune the AI to be more effective for future questions of a similar type.  Much like Google caches search requests to help speed up the reponse for the next similar request, the AI can be trained to answer questions more effectively when it has domain specific knowledge.  Medical  Financial  Industrial  ScienceEvery domain of knowledge is currently being innovated with AI augmented knowledge management systems to to help bridge a skills gap between entry level employees and their seasoned professionals who may be looking to retire soon.  How many businesses are running today who have ‚Äúthe button‚Äù that should never be pushed but nobody remembers why.Sharing the knowledgeHow do you feel about sharing medical, banking and other sensitive information with an AI?What if that AI is yours, tuned and trained on your information, emails, text, medical history, banking, investments, friends, family.  Before you say ‚Äúfrightening‚Äù, just know that Meta (Facebook), Microsoft and Google have built artificial ‚Äúpersonas‚Äù based on real world information.  Instead of it helping you live a more fulfilling life or spend your money and time more wisely it‚Äôs used to target you and others in your sphere of influence to buy things.Your data should benefit YOU.Businesses continue to invest in AI intermediaries to the point that all your customer interactions with the company is brokered by an AI.Why not have that interaction brokered by your own AI.Do no harm - The Three LawsWhen Asimov conceived the Three Laws of Robotics in 1942, he knew that humans would eventually build autonomous reasoning machines that such laws would be necessary.  # 1 - An AI may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.  # 2 - An AI must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.  # 3 - An AI must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.Harm can come in the form of poor life choices. If I‚Äôm being lazy and want a burger instead of making myself a salad this can cause harm.  Not immediately but it certainly wouldn‚Äôt be in my best interest if I knew my LDL was high in my last blood test and going for the burger and shake combo would certainly make that worse.What if our AI could look out for us by making sure that our pantry is stocked with healthy choices.  So at 7PM on a Tuesday night I start a search for ‚ÄúBurgers near me‚Äù my AI might remind me that I have all the ingredients to make a delicious chikpea salad.  Or if I‚Äôm insisting on being lazy here are some vegan restaurants nearby that offer delivery with recommended dishes from each for me to choose."

    "content": "Asteroid mining is hard, it is harder if you cannot find what you are looking for. We are going to use low power hardware (M2 Pro 16GB 512GB) to run a Large Language Model, IBM granite3.1-dense:8b, via Ollama to classify asteroids and elements so that we can easily answer the following question.  How much is an asteroid worth?Based on it‚Äôs class, it will likely contain certain elements.  Some M (Metallic) class asteroids are known to have high concentrations of platinum group metals. Platinums value is over $900+ per oz!  To keep life simple I will be measuring all mining quantities in kilograms.  35.27 oz in 1 kg. $900 x 35.27 oz = $31,743 per kg of platinum. It‚Äôs trading far above $900 at this moment so let‚Äôs round up to $32k per 1 kg of Platinum.Classifying AsteroidsWith a collection of 958524 asteroids, thanks to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakhawat18/asteroid-dataset, it is important for my use case that they have a class of either C (Carbonaceous), S (Silicaceous), M (Metallic), or O (Other, unclassified).https://github.com/fullaware/ollama-pydantic?tab=readme-ov-file#3-update_asteroids_classespyElement Uses119 Elements in the periodic table, we have all the information you could imagine on elements thanks to https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON.I wanted to know what usecases each element could be used for in the context of ‚Äúbenefits space exploration‚Äù. 12 usecases that could easily overlap several of the 119 elements.\"fuel\", \"lifesupport\", \"energystorage\", \"construction\", \"electronics\", \"coolants\", \"industrial\", \"medical\", \"propulsion\", \"shielding\", \"agriculture\", \"mining\"I also wanted to show the likelihood of each element appearing in each class of asteroid [C, S, and M]. I used Pydantic and Ollama to read each element and update its document with its uses and classes.For instance Hydrogen now has the following fields:\"uses\": [    \"fuel\",    \"energystorage\",    \"industrial\",    \"propulsion\"  ],\"classes\": [    {      \"class\": \"C\",      \"percentage\": 30    },    {      \"class\": \"S\",      \"percentage\": 35    },    {      \"class\": \"M\",      \"percentage\": 5    }  ]https://github.com/fullaware/ollama-pydantic?tab=readme-ov-file#2-update_element_uses_mdbpyLet‚Äôs go hunting!  Find the asteroid(s) closest to Earth measured in Astronomical Units  Estimate it‚Äôs value  Flight plan - estimate the total number of days to intersect, days to establish site, days to fill cargo to capacity, days to return (considering additional mass)  Based on the value of the elements x capacity of cargo = mission value  Send ship, survive, return with valuable resources, get paid.Where are you? [AU]Key to finding anything in space is finding it‚Äôs relation to something significant, like our SUN. The distance from Earth to the Sun is 1 Astronomical Unit. Each asteroid has a moid field which stands for minimum orbital intersection distance measured in Astronomical Units aka closest distance between the asteroid and Earth.For instance Ceres has a moid of 1.59478 AU.  1 AU is 149,597,871 km, so Ceres is 238,575,692 km from Earth at its closest point.With the absolute latest in human engineering it‚Äôs theoretically possible to get from Earth to Mars in 45 days. The distance from Earth to Mars is 0.52 AU or 78,340,000 km. 78,340,000 km / 45 days =1,740,889 km per day or 72,537 km per hour.This means it would take us 137 days to get to the asteroid Ceres.238,575,692 km to Ceres / 1,740,889 km per day = 137 daysTurn Class into CashCeres is a C class asteroid. Hydrogen has a 30% chance of occuring in a C class asteroid.  What about the other 118 elements?Now that that we have each of our asteroids and elements properly classified, let‚Äôs query them and see how they fit together![  {    $match: {      full_name: \"1 Ceres\"    }  },  {    $lookup: {      from: \"elements\",      localField: \"class\",      foreignField: \"classes.class\",      as: \"elements_info\"    }  },  {    $project: {      \"full_name\": 1,      \"elements_info.name\": 1,      \"elements_info.classes\": 1    }  }]Results in a JSON object representation of the asteroid with all 119 elements embedded.{  \"_id\": {    \"$oid\": \"67c8fb9e9b4c595879243f64\"  },  \"full_name\": \"1 Ceres\",  \"elements_info\": [    {      \"name\": \"Hydrogen\",      \"classes\": [        {          \"class\": \"C\",          \"percentage\": 30        },        {          \"class\": \"S\",          \"percentage\": 50        },        {          \"class\": \"M\",          \"percentage\": 20        }      ]    },    { ... }  ]}In this case, we can estimate that Hydrogen has a 30% chance to appear in Ceres.Mine, all mineDue to Ceres size, it is fair to say that multiple mining sites could exist over this 939.4 km diameter asteroid.  It‚Äôs mass is estimated to be 938,390,000,000,000,000,000 kg.Dig itWe are going to estimate our mining ship can extract 10,000 kg of material per hour or 240,000 kg of material per day based on published surface mining data.  In mining, gangue is the commercially worthless material that surrounds, or is closely mixed with, a wanted mineral in an ore deposit.  For example, say you have 10,000 kg of rock you have mined for platinum that has an ore grade of 10%. This means you only get 1,000 kg of platinum and 9,000 kg of gangue that you have to separate and get rid of (10% platinum ore would be very high grade). Ceres would have 93,839,000,000,000,000,000 kg of actual elements if we assume high grade ore occurance, or $3,002,848,000,000,000,000,000 if all elements are similar in value to Platinum.  Ceres could be worth up to three sextillion, two quintillion, eight hundred forty-eight quadrillion dollars!  24,000 kg per day of useful elements if all goes well.Logistics and costsThe Falcon Heavy can lift 50,000 kg into space and lower it back down. That‚Äôs $1.6 billion dollars in platinum.The Falcon Heavy has 2 costs models;  Reusable: US $97 million  Expendable: US$150 millionIf your ship + cargo makes it back, great (minus several million in repairs)!  If it doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs going to cost $150 million to try again.Operational costs per day      137 days to Ceres.        3 days to establish mining site.        1 day to mine.        1 day to prep for return.        137 days to Earth.  Piloted by 3 AIs to form a quorum will help ensure mission success. Each specializing in specific fields;  non-terrestrial mining operations  astral navigation  resource management$45,000 per day based on a $16M+ annual run rate.  Play with those numbers as you would like.  279 days @ $45K per day is $12.5M total mission operational costs.TL;DR$150M to launch, $50 million saved if you can reuse it for future missions.$12.5M mission operation costs.$162.5M total investment.$1.6B in recovered resources.$1.5B in profits!!Take that and invest in a fleet of shuttles and own the stars. Repeat as needed."

    "content": "ObjectiveLet‚Äôs use MongoDB to build an asteroid tagging engine that allows us to assign multiple elements to any asteroid then query based on those elements.Schema designArrays allow you to assign an arbitrary number of elements to a document.  MongoDB allows you to insert, update and delete elements within arrays.A requirement of our tagging engine is we want to be able to change the name of the element without having to update each document with the new name.  For this we will be keeping the element labels in a separate collection and reference them by _id just as we would in a SQL database.  This works out great when we want to add metadata to the elements such as atomic weight or symbol.Collection : ElementsFor this example we will use simple _id numbers instead of ObjectIds.{    \"_id\" : 100,    \"label\" : \"iron\"},{    \"_id\" : 101,    \"label\" : \"nickel\"   },{    \"_id\" : 102,    \"label\" : \"cobalt\"   },{    \"_id\" : 103,    \"label\" : \"platinum\"   },{    \"_id\" : 104,    \"label\" : \"olivine\"   },{    \"_id\" : 105,    \"label\" : \"potassium\"   },{    \"_id\" : 106,    \"label\" : \"silicon\"   },{    \"_id\" : 107,    \"label\" : \"magnesium\"   },{    \"_id\" : 108,    \"label\" : \"phosphorus\"},{    \"_id\" : 109,    \"label\" : \"silver\"},{    \"_id\" : 110,    \"label\" : \"gold\"}Collection : Asteroids{    \"_id\" : 1000,    \"name\" : \"Bennu\",    \"elements\" : [100, 101, 108]},{    \"_id\" : 1001,    \"name\" : \"Ceres\",    \"elements\" : [106, 103, 108]},{    \"_id\" : 1002,    \"name\" : \"Pallas\",    \"elements\" : [103, 102, 105]},{    \"_id\" : 1003,    \"name\" : \"Juno\",    \"elements\" : [107, 106, 100]},{    \"_id\" : 1004,    \"name\" : \"Vesta\",    \"elements\" : [108, 101, 103]},{    \"_id\" : 1005,    \"name\" : \"Astraea\",    \"elements\" : [105, 101, 106]}$lookup - MongoDB JOIN[    {        '$lookup': {            'from': 'elements',             'localField': 'elements',             'foreignField': '_id',             'as': 'result'        }    }]Returns all asteroid documents with the cooresponding element names from the elements collection. Example:{  \"_id\": 1000,  \"name\": \"Bennu\",  \"elements\": [    100,    101,    108  ],  \"result\": [    {      \"_id\": 100,      \"label\": \"iron\"    },    {      \"_id\": 101,      \"label\": \"nickel\"    },    {      \"_id\": 108,      \"label\": \"phosphorus\"    }  ]}This pattern allows us to rename the element labels as needed without having to update the 1000‚Äôs of asteroids with that specific element name.  This model is certainly DRY [Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself] as well as very SQL like, having a foreign key relationship from the elements array to the Elements collection.Find the nickelFind all the asteroids that are known to have nickel in them.[    {        '$match': {            'label': 'nickel'        }    }, {        '$lookup': {            'from': 'asteroids',             'localField': '_id',             'foreignField': 'elements',             'as': 'asteroids'        }    }]Returns the element document with each of the asteroids embedded in the asteroids array.{  \"_id\": 101,  \"label\": \"nickel\",  \"asteroids\": [    {      \"_id\": 1000,      \"name\": \"Bennu\",      \"elements\": [        100,        101,        108      ]    },    {      \"_id\": 1004,      \"name\": \"Vesta\",      \"elements\": [        108,        101,        103      ]    },    {      \"_id\": 1005,      \"name\": \"Astraea\",      \"elements\": [        105,        101,        106      ]    }  ]}Inserting multiple elements into an arrayAccording to the document, we see that the asteroid Bennu is made up of iron, nickel, and phosphorus.  Let‚Äôs add a couple more elements like silver and gold.We will do this by using the MongoDB operator $addToSet.db.asteroids.update_one(    {\"_id\": 1000},    {\"$addToSet\": {        \"elements\": {            \"$each\":            [109,110]}}})Gold streakLets imagine new sensor technology has allowed us to find gold in not one but MULTIPLE asteroids, let‚Äôs update the collection with this new information!  We are going to reuse the $addToSet operator here so that if we wanted to add multiple elements to multiple asteroids, we could totally do so.db.asteroids.update_many(    {        '_id': {            '$in': [                1002,                1003            ]        }    },    {\"$addToSet\": {        \"elements\": {            \"$each\":            [110]}}})Mistakes happenSometimes the sensors are all wrong, let‚Äôs delete this element from those asteroids.  Again I‚Äôm going to use an operator that allows you to delete multiple elements from multiple asteroids.  In this case we are only going to delete 110 from asteroids 1002 and 1003.db.asteroids.update_many(    {        '_id': {            '$in': [                1002,                1003            ]        }    },    {\"$pull\": {        \"elements\": {            \"$in\":            [110]}}})"
